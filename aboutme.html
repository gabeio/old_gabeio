					Well I guess you want to know more about me... In a nut<u>shell</u>, I am a Software Engineer that loves to be random and free.
					I enjoy my privacy, security, and sometimes the loneliness that comes with being a programmer. As at times humans are impossible to deal with.
					This is a significant portion of why I fell in love with computers. But mostly I thought they were awesome and that even back when I was
					starting to use a computer I wanted to know more. That love to learn more about computers never stopped. I still love to learn all I can
					even if it's the smallest detail. At the moment, I am working on sites with different groups of friends, hopefully they will be a hit on launch.

					Currently I like to program in Python or Node.js though I have been known to stray to C, C++ and Java. I am significantly familiar with syntax
					and debugging (obviously) but I do love getting down and dirty looking for bugs. As stated on the home page if you want to contact me the best
					way would be to email: me @ gabe [dot] io.
